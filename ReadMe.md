To extract dictionary entries from DOCX files as described in the provided Python code, you would need to install the `python-docx` library. Here are the necessary pip install commands:

```bash
pip install python-docx
```

If you intend to use the code with the pandas functionality for combining CSV files (as shown in previous steps), you would also need to install `pandas`:

```bash
pip install pandas
```

After running these commands, you should have all the necessary libraries installed to execute the provided Python code.
Here's the full Python code to extract the dictionary entries from the provided DOCX files:

```python
import re
import csv
from docx import Document

def extract_entries_without_superscripts(paragraphs):
    """
    Extract dictionary entries from the given paragraphs.
    
    Parameters:
    - paragraphs (list): List of paragraphs from the DOCX file.
    
    Returns:
    - list: Extracted dictionary entries.
    """
    entries = []
    current_word = None
    current_definition = ""

    for para in paragraphs:
        # Check for potential word/phrase entries
        match = re.match(r'^([â€˜a-zA-Z\-]+)[0-9]*,', para)
        if match:
            if current_word and current_definition:
                entries.append((current_word, current_definition.strip()))
            
            current_word = match.group(1)
            current_definition = para[len(current_word):].strip()
        else:
            current_definition += " " + para

    # Add the last entry
    if current_word and current_definition:
        entries.append((current_word, current_definition.strip()))
    
    return entries

def extract_from_docx_and_save_to_csv(docx_filepath, csv_filepath):
    """
    Extract dictionary entries from the given DOCX file and save to a CSV file.
    
    Parameters:
    - docx_filepath (str): Path to the DOCX file.
    - csv_filepath (str): Path to the destination CSV file.
    """
    # Load the document
    doc = Document(docx_filepath)

    # Extract entries from the document
    extracted_entries = extract_entries_without_superscripts([para.text for para in doc.paragraphs])

    # Write the extracted entries to the CSV file
    with open(csv_filepath, 'w', newline='', encoding='utf-8') as file:
        writer = csv.writer(file)
        writer.writerow(["Word/Phrase", "Description & Definition"])  # Header row
        writer.writerows(extracted_entries)  # Data rows

# Example usage:
# docx_path = "/path/to/your/docx/file.docx"
# csv_path = "/path/to/save/extracted/entries.csv"
# extract_from_docx_and_save_to_csv(docx_path, csv_path)
```

To use the code, replace `/path/to/your/docx/file.docx` with the path to your DOCX file and `/path/to/save/extracted/entries.csv` with the path where you want to save the extracted entries in CSV format. Then, run the code in your Python environment.
