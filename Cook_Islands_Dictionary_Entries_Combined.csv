-a-,"4, morph. Pluralising element arising from lengthening of the stem vowel a in the nouns tāngata, men, tuā‘ine, sisters, vā‘ine, women."

Tei te a‘a ‘a Pōtiki? what is Pōtiki doing?; kua tāmataora ‘a Ngāti Makea i te manu‘iri. the Makea clan entertained the visitors; kua ‘aere ‘a mea ki te tautai? has what’s his name gone fishing?; ka ‘apai ‘a Tūpapa i te rē.

‘aka-,"2, morph. N.B. Many words contain-ing the prefix ‘aka- can be used in more than one of the following ways. Words beginning with ‘aka-, which is an ex-tremely productive affix, are entered in alphabetical position in the body of the dictionary. (cf. ‘a-8 which is nearly synonymous with ‘aka in sense 3 below, and tā-7.) 1. Causative or ergative, to cause or make something happen. Used typically to convert intransitive into transi-tive sentences. The subject of the intransi-tive sentence becomes the object of the transitive sentence, thus allowing the agent (the performer of the action) to be introduced as the subject of the ‘aka- sentence. Compare kua kī te pi‘a. the box is full: kua ‘akakī ‘aia i te pi‘a. he filled the box; kua ma‘ora te kie. the sail unfurled: kua ‘akama‘ora rāua i te kie. they unfurled the sail; ora, to go free: ‘akaora, to set free; ‘oki, to go back: ‘aka‘oki, to send back; ‘ope, to be at an end: ‘aka‘ope, to bring to an end. 2. Used to convert the subject of an under-lying transitive sentence into a secondary agent or instrument (marked by the prep. ki), thus allowing a primary agent to be intro-duced as the subject of the ‘aka- sentence. Kua kakati te puakaoa i te tamaiti. the dog bit the child; kua ‘akakakati te va‘ine i te puakaoa ki te tamaiti. the woman made the dog bite the child; kua ‘ongi au i te tiare. I sniffed the flower; kua ‘aka‘ongi te va‘ine i te tiare kiāku, the woman got me to sniff the flower. 3. Used before a few noun stems. Atua, God; ‘akaatua, to deify, make a god of; ‘enemi, enemy; ‘aka-‘enemi, to alienate, make an enemy of. 4. Inchoative: to become, to start to happen. Used before intransitive verbs which denote states or conditions, it indicates the coming about of that state or condition; before verbs which denote actions, it indicates the commencing or performing of that action.
